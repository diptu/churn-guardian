Predicting customer churn with DL techniques

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical business problem: retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
This project demonstrates a **classic ML use case** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN/MLP)** to predict whether a customer will churn.

The repo is designed as a **learning + portfolio project** and walks through the **entire ML lifecycle**:
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – uncover trends & churn patterns
- 🛠️ **Feature Engineering** – prepare structured data for modeling
- 🧠 **Model Building (ANN/MLP in PyTorch)** – deep learning for binary classification
- 📊 **Model Interpretability** – explain the "why" behind predictions
- 🚀 **Deployment** – serve predictions via a FastAPI API (containerized with Docker)

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build practical **hands-on expertise** in ML & Deep Learning with PyTorch
- Strengthen **portfolio** with a **business-relevant case study**
- Showcase **end-to-end workflow** from data to deployment

---
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.11**
- **PyTorch** for ANN (MLP) model
- **Pandas / NumPy / Matplotlib / Seaborn** for EDA
- **Scikit-learn** for preprocessing & evaluation
- **SHAP / Captum** for model interpretability
- **FastAPI** for serving predictions
- **Docker** for deployment


---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- [ ] Containerize model with Docker & deploy FastAPI
- [ ] Add monitoring & logging (Prometheus + Grafana)
